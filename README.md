# Automated generated file for Social Network Analysis

The aim of the project is to explore and apply the concepts of social network analysis to detect fraudulent behaviour within networks. Using centrality measures such as degree centrality, interdependence centrality, proximity centrality and eigenvector centrality, the project evaluates the influence of individuals within a network and assesses the risk of fraud. Two approaches are proposed: a basic analysis based on individuals' connections and an advanced approach that integrates centrality measures with pre-existing fraud scores to predict the probability of an individual's involvement in fraudulent activities.
